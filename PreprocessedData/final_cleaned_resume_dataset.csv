Information Technology,Resume Guide BOSTON UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING CAREER DEVELOPMENT OFFICE 44 CUMMINGTON STREET ROOM 112 BOSTON MA 02215 617 353 5731 ENGCAREER@BU EDU WWW BU EDU ENG CAREERS Last updated September 2009 TABLE OF CONTENTS Why a Resume 3 Components of a Resume 3 5 Format 3 Header 4 Objective 4 Education 4 Experience 4 Skills 5 Activities Affiliations 5 Interests 5 Other Possible Section Headings 5 The Glance Test 5 Other Miscellaneous Information You Should Know 6 Action Verb List 7 Sample Resume Appendix 9 2 WHY A RESUME Resumes are an extremely important part of the job search process namely to secure an interview A resume is a one or two page at most summary of your skills accomplishments experiences and education designed to capture a prospective employer s interest The resume is also a great way to capture and organize neatly and concisely your skills and experience which will be very useful when it comes time to interview The resume is the primary tool of your job search and may take several drafts to prepare effectively Resumes must do their work quickly Employers or Human Resources personnel may look through hundreds of resumes for a particular position and may spend only a few seconds reviewing each To get someone to look at it longer your resume must convey quickly that you are capable and competent enough to be worth an interview Employers use this tool to screen potential candidates before granting interviews so the goal is to use the resume to entice the employer to want to meet you The more thoroughly you prepare your resume now the more likely someone is to read it later COMPONENTS OF A RESUME There are four basic styles of resumes REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL Also called simply Chronological this is the most common resume format It s also the simplest to create Education and Experience are each listed by category in reverse chronological most recent first order The chronological resume is usually best for undergraduates and entry level candidates This handout will focus primarily on the chronological resume format FUNCTIONAL experience sorted by relevance to career objective A functional resume differs from a chronological resume by concentrating on skills that you have used that relate to your stated objective rather than on the jobs you have had A functional resume is particularly effective if your work experience has not been closely related to your job objective if you are changing careers or if you are seeking a promotion In this format you elaborate on the skills necessary to perform the desired job and how you have demonstrated those same skills in different types of jobs Because the Functional Resume is not recommended for most entry level candidates it will not be described in detail in this handout COMBINATION The combination chronological functional resume uses elements of both styles The qualifications areas of effectiveness of the functional resume remain within specific job experience descriptions The jobs experiences are then grouped and categorized to show the strengths in two to four categories This resume format is effective if at least some of your experience is related to the job objective and also when the job objective has more than one component and you have experience in these different components e g technical and management sales and organizational Because the Combination Resume is not recommended for most entry level candidates it will not be described in detail in this handout CURRICULUM VITAE Also called a CV this is a highly specialized resume format used by those individuals seeking a teaching and or research position in a postsecondary institution or high level research industry Information in all categories should be in reverse chronological order the most recent data first 3 Creating your Chronological Resume I Header Your contact information Your name should be the biggest item on the page and be on its own line Use an address where you can receive correspondence Supply the phone number whose line offers you the most privacy for you to speak professionally on ensure you have a PROFESSIONAL greeting on your answering machine Include your e mail address DO NOT list your age gender religion political affiliation marital status health status or social security number II Objective A clear and concise statement that can communicate the following The position or field you desire and your long term goals The position or field you are pursuing and the skills you wish to use The position or field you desire and the responsibilities you are seeking REMEMBER a poor objective can hurt a resume Be sure NOT to use vague general statements e g Electrical engineering graduate looking to apply leadership and technical skills to a challenging position with potential for growth III Education Where you can indicate your educational and academic background Name of Institution City State Type of degree Bachelor of Science Master of Science Ph D Date of graduation or anticipated graduation date Additional Sub headings under Education could be Academic Projects especially Senior Design Project which can be a separate sub heading Related Coursework 4 6 courses that relate to the employer and or position no more than 8 Honors Deans List with semesters Honor Societies Scholarships Awards Academic Honors etc Optional information could be GPA if 3 0 or above general rule of thumb if GPA is not above a 3 0 do not include it Fundamentals of Engineering Exam can be phrased Certified Engineer in Training Date once you ve passed Hours worked to finance % of your education Any relevant seminars or workshops you ve attended IV Experience Information that should be included Name of company Location of company city state Dates of employment Job Titles and if applicable department Provide a brief job description bulleted list or short paragraph using appropriate action verbs that emphasize your strengths Make sure you use the proper verb tense o Focus on your significant achievements and contributions o Focus on how you saved the employer time and money o QUANTIFY your accomplishments whenever possible For example Project scheduled for 49 days completed in 27 and Software enhancements cut required purchase processing time by 38 percent If applicable you can divide your work experience into two categories Experience or Related Experience and Additional Experience or Other Experience 4 V Skills There are three different skill sets that can be listed as sub headings under Skills or be their own main heading Computer Skills List ALL computer skills in some type of order Language Skills If need be you can break these out into Fluent in and Conversational in Lab Skills VI Activities Affiliations List any memberships or affiliations you have indicating any offices held and achievements related to these activities Membership in an engineering society honor societies student organizations etc VII Interests not essential This section is used to show that you are a well rounded individual List any hobbies or interests that you feel might add spice to your profile Make sure that the information you provide is appropriate and useful VIII Other Possible Section Headings Citizenship Military Experience Publications and or Patents held or pending Volunteer Community Activities THE GLANCE TEST To make sure your resume looks flawless and noticeable you want to make sure that your resume will pass the glance test You should ask yourself these questions when preparing for the glance test Is your format consistent throughout the resume o If you use periods use periods throughout o Use the same bullets throughout o If indenting indent the same amount each time o Make sure top and bottom margins are equal and right and left margins are equal o Use standard typefaces such as Arial Helvetica Universe Times Palatino Century and Courier o Use a font size of 10 to 14 points Avoid Times New Roman 10 point o Avoid fancy treatments such as italics underline shadows and reverse white letters on black background o Avoid vertical and horizontal lines graphics and boxes o Avoid two column format or resumes that look like newspapers or newsletters o List each phone number and e mail on its own line Do you have too much or not enough white space o You want to make sure that you format the resume so that the white space is kept to a minimum while not overwhelming the reader with too much text Does your resume look symmetrical Have you SPELL CHECKED There is NO excuse for a misspelled word and recruiters may view it as laziness Are you utilizing action verbs A list of actions verbs can be found on page 7 Have you proofread Once you ve answered these questions to your satisfaction and corrected any problems found proceed with the glance test Hold your resume in front of you for ten seconds does it look good are you satisfied with your work 5 OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW When writing numbers numbers one ten should be spelled out numbers 11 12 13 14 can be written using the number symbol When describing your past experience use verbs written in the past tense Designed When describing your present experience use present tense verbs Design WHAT NOT TO PUT ON A RESUME There are certain pieces of information that you should never include on your resume These include Your social security number Who knows who s hands your resume could fall into Identity theft is a very real problem and they don t need your SSN until after you ve been hired anyway Personal information that could be used to discriminate against you An employer doesn t need to know your age race religion gender marital status whether or not you have kids your nation of origin your weight your height your sexual orientation or your politics None of that has anything to do with your ability to carry out the requirements of the job It s illegal for employers to even ask you for that information while you re applying so you shouldn t volunteer the information References The only person who s name should be on your resume is yourself It s good to have references that you can give to an employer when they ask but they should always be on a separate document which you give to the employer only after they ve asked It s common to conclude a resume with References Available Upon Request and there s nothing wrong with including that if you have room but it s generally assumed by most employers that you can provide references when asked Anything negative Did you get fired from a previous job Did you get laid off because your boss ran the company into the ground Do you hate eating your vegetables Whatever it is keep it to yourself You don t want to look like a complainer and you certainly don t want to look like a backstabber Only provide positive information about yourself and never badmouth a previous employer even if working for them was the worst experience of your entire life First person pronouns Using words like I me my etc just doesn t look very professional Avoid them which should be easier if you re making an effort to start sentences with verbs The only place it s appropriate to use a first person pronoun is in your Objective statement or possibly referring to we on a group project but try to avoid it Your picture You re applying for a professional position not auditioning for a TV show They don t need a headshot RECRUITERS TOP 10 RESUME PET PEEVES Recently ResumeDoctor com1 asked more than 2 500 recruiters from a variety of industries what their pet peeves were when it comes to resumes 1 Spelling Errors Typos and Poor Grammar make sure you spell check AND proofread 2 Too Duty Oriented don t just write the company s summary of your position explain your accomplishments 3 Inaccurate Dates or None at All this missing or inaccurate information could send up red flags 4 Inaccurate or Missing Contact Information if a recruiter can t reach you they will move on to someone else 5 Poor Formatting 6 Functional Resumes 7 Long Resumes too much information will simply waste a recruiter s time 8 Long Paragraphs stay focused and concise 9 Unqualified Candidates 10 Personal Information Unrelated to the Job 6 ACTION VERBS Good use of action verbs can mean the difference when it comes to getting your foot in the door and being invited for an interview Remember a hiring manager probably sees dozens of resumes for each position they re trying to fill each with a similar list of skills and experience The key is to make sure yours gets noticed When describing experience try to start each sentence with an action verb Don t use the same verb repeatedly and don t limit yourself to this list A B accelerated acclimated accompanied accomplished achieved acquired acted activated actuated adapted added addressed adhered adjusted administered admitted adopted advanced advertised advised advocated aided aired affected allocated altered amended amplified analyzed answered anticipated appointed appraised approached approved arbitrated arranged ascertained asked

Linux preempt rt patch C Trace32 shell script Visual Studio Vim Trace32 Debugging Tool SVN TFS gdb eldk cross compilers In case of propriety RTOS like vxWorks a large amount of time and money had to be invested in terms of both development and licensing cost Also much time was required to port ABB applications to APIs that were not completely POSIX compliant and it increased the reliance on single vendor All these problems could be overcome by using an open source OS like linux while still maintaining the real time constraints using preempt rt patch This was a research project that

software brings using an open source Linux BSP allowed the customer to use a number of COTS commercially off the shelf components that drastically reduced the time to marked especially since many libraries useful for robotics applications are readily available for Linux platforms like vision libraries Ability to port languages like python perl etc which can be readily done on linux but is extremely time consuming on other real time platforms like vxworks Such porting does not provide any value addition to ABB robotics and yet increases time to market Project Name Description Role Work

Peer Career Advisor Program hours by calling the Career Center at 312 362 8437 Loop Campus or 773 325 7431 Lincoln Park Campus Contents I Resume Purpose Design & Mechanics Page 3 II Key Elements of a Successful Resumes Page 4 This document is intended to guide you in creating your resume by outlining important types of information to include and tips for doing so in a professional and persuasive manner Please note this is not intended as a template and the format employed may or may not best represent you Consider meeting with a Peer Career Advisor to discuss how you might best layout your own resume III Transferable Skills & Action Verbs Page 5 Transferable skills are those that can be applied in a variety of industries and job functions Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a great place to start when composing your resume This list is a sampling of the types of skills you might highlight on your resume in addition to those skills that are more specific to your major intended industry or job function A sampling of action verbs is also included on this page Be sure to use strong action verbs to begin each of your bulleted statements previewing the skill to be exemplified through the accomplishment statement IV Chronological Resume Samples Pages 6 11 In this most commonly accepted resume format job titles and employers are emphasized starting with your most recent experiences to illustrate a progressive work history Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements under each position This resume type is recommended for people who have recently graduated with a bachelor s degree those who are staying within the same career field and candidates with few time gaps in their job history This type is most often preferred by employers because it is easy to scan highlights job titles employers and dates and clearly ties candidates skills and accomplishments to their work histories V Functional & Combination Resume Samples Pages 12 13 This format is an option for candidates who have changed employers frequently have gaps in their employment history or are hoping to transition to a new industry or unrelated job function Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight transferable skills placing less emphasis on employment dates job titles and employers VI Additional Career Center Resume Resources Page 14 2 I Resume Purpose Design & Mechanics The purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education experience and skills ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview When conceptualizing your resume think of it as a marketing tool rather than a simple work history as it is intended to promote you as the perfect candidate for the opportunity at hand Resume writing is an art not a science There is no one correct way to formulate a resume but there are some best practices and standards that the Career Center recommends Stand out from the crowd with high quality content and a clearly written error free document Sequence the information from most important to least important with regard to your career objective When constructing bullet points aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify the skills you possess and employers are seeking Length With a few rare exceptions when applying for internships or entry level jobs students should keep their resume to 1 page If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume consider removing elements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying Margins Make your resume visually attractive Use some whitespace to allow the reader s eye to rest Using 5 inch to 1 5 inch margins is recommended Font Use a font that is easy to read Times New Roman Arial and Courier New are good choices A 10 12 point font size is recommended Consistency Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume For example if you choose to bold a job title make sure you bold every job title Also make sure that all of your bullet points section headers dates etc line up neatly on the page Accuracy Your resume and all other job search materials must be 100% error free Be sure to carefully read through your resume checking grammar spelling and punctuation It is a good idea to have at least 2 3 people proofread it as well Be Accomplishment Orientated Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when you have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking Describe achievements rather than listing duties quantify outcomes whenever possible and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical industry or job function specific and transferable skills Use Action Verbs Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the skill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement This allows a potential employer to more easily scan your resume for what he or she is seeking Make it Clear and Be Succinct Eliminate the pronoun I at the beginning of each bullet point as this is assumed Avoid introductory and wind up phrases such as My duties included and My responsibilities were Overall Appearance Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking Also consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less Make sure that your most important information stands out 3 II Key Elements of a Successful Resume Your First and Last Name Phone number Email address Street address City state & zip code

kind of position you are looking to obtain If you choose to include this section be sure to specify the kind of industry and work you would like to do Try not to be so general that the objective is

Arlington office o Too specific This objective tells the employer that you only want a position as an accounts specialist and only in one branch office If there is a similar position in a different office you may not be considered Seeking an internship position o Too general This objective does not add any value to your resume as it does not clarify industry or experiences you are looking to gain Seeking an entry level accounting position in top tier financial services firm with opportunities to both work with a diverse client base and gain experience in corporate accounts o Good A nice balance of the general industry interests and experiences the person is seeking without limiting what they might be considered for QUALIFICATION HIGHLIGHTS PROFESSIONAL PROFILE Optional This section

document but if you would like to view more resume samples log on to Jobs4Saints and visit their Resume Gallery CURRICULUM VITAE CVs A Curriculum Vitae in the United States is a special kind of resume like document that is primarily used by college professors and individuals pursuing high level education research or executive careers It is very similar to the traditional resume only it is much longer no page limit and includes additional sections for Research Publications Teaching Training Experience etc It may also go into more detail than a traditional resume about the types of accomplishments a person has made CVs in the US are highly tailored to each position and are written in a similar format to the resume the difference being in length and additional section headings For additional assistance in constructing a CV please contact the Center for Career Services It is important to note that many other countries especially European countries like the United Kingdom France etc refer to what Americans call a traditional resume as a CV This means that if you are applying to a company in London England and they ask for a CV they are really asking for your traditional 1 2 page US resume with some additional information For information about writing resumes for careers abroad contact the Center for Career Services and or the Center for Global Education FEDERAL RESUMES Federal resumes are written similarly to public and private sector resumes but differ in a few specific ways The section headings for a Federal resume are generally the same and experiences are described either in paragraphs or bullet points Here are the ways a Federal resume differs from other resumes Federal resumes have no page limit and are generally 3 5 pages long depending on experience The OBJECTIVE section of a Federal resume contains the title and GS code for the position Federal resumes contain significantly more personal information including your Social Security Number Citizenship Status Veteran s Status and Security Clearances Experiences are described much more in depth and include information about your salary hours worked address of company you worked at supervisor s name and contact and if it is all right to contact them There is no timeline limit for Federal resumes you should include all work experiences regardless of relevance Marymount

planned assigned strategize financed Page 4 FORMATTING YOUR RESUME OR CV The length of your resume or CV will depend on your level of experience and qualifications Generally a graduate resume should be 2 3 full pages and a CV should be 3 5 pages long However based on your experiences career field and the position description it could be longer or shorter Whatever the case only print your document on one side of the paper and include your name and the page number at the top of each page Avoid using a resume or CV template This decreases your ability to personalize and make changes as your document evolves Your resume or CV should be well organized without spelling errors and easy to read An employer spends a short amount of time reading your document it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications To organize your document you may choose to use bold italics all caps indenting and bullets You will want to use these sparingly to emphasize the most important information Avoid pictures graphics non black ink shading and symbols instead of traditional round solid bullet points It is a good idea to start with a 1 inch margin on each side You can expand the margins if need be Font size should be between 10 12 point and you will want to choose easy to read font styles such as Times New Roman Arial or Garamond Keep font size and style consistent throughout your CV except for your name which should be a larger size Present your resume or CV on quality bond paper 20 pound choose white or off white to ensure your document is easy to read If you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your document directly keep the format simple when filling in required information If you are requested to submit your documents via email save your resume or CV and cover letter if applicable as attachments Include a brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose TIPS FOR RESUME AND CV WRITING Make sure that your resume or CV is a unique and personal document It is a great idea to look at examples of resumes or CVs but also important to make it your own There are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume or CV but there are also options and room for choice If you give your document to several people they may all give you different feedback Beyond some of our strongly suggested guidelines resumes and CVs are subjective Be 100% honest and factual Avoid abbreviations Organize your document so the most important information is at the top Do not include a work history Rather include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of skill Personal information such as marital status age ethnicity height and weight should not be included Avoid personal pronouns I my we and complete sentences to describe your experiences Start your statements with action verbs Always proofread your resume or CV Do not solely rely on spell check Some employers may eliminate candidates based on errors It is suggested that you tailor your resume or CV to the job description You may have more than one version of your document depending on the positions to which you are applying You may change the order of sections to list more relevant areas of your experience closer to the top Remember that your resume or CV is YOUR marketing tool Many times it is an employer s first impression of you It is also a work in progress that you will continually revise ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Visit to view our Resume Writing or Curriculum Vitae Workshops Visit the CSE Career Center Resource Center to

at a high level was the first thing I was drawn to while reviewing your website One sentence packed with a great deal of meaning The strides Stanley Boyd has made in math and reading to achieve 90% of your students passing their reading tests and 83% proficient or advanced in Math is something of which I hope to be a part It is for these reasons I would love the opportunity to join your community as a 2nd grade teacher In May 2013 I will be graduating from St Norbert College in De Pere Wisconsin with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Elementary Education and a minor in Language Arts My strengths in building connections with students faculty and parents using technology to effectively enhance the classroom and differentiate instruction based on the needs of my students are just a few of things I can offer to Stanley Boyd Some of the ways I build strong relationships with students faculty and parents is through attending after school events participating in a district meeting and opening lines of communication via newsletters e mails phone calls and conferences Two additional strengths I possess are the ability to use technology effectively and differentiate and engage students For example with my first grade students I used iPads during guided reading where high leveled students spelled sight words middle leveled students read sight words and lower leveled students traced letters while practicing letter sounds Another example is in 8th grade advanced Language Arts where students read a novel regarding utopias Students then reflected on their own utopia wrote about it and then presented using WebPages movies or podcast Finally at the end of the year students reflected on the unit choosing their favorite piece many chose to write about the technology I am excited about this opportunity to join your team of educators and bring my various strengths with me I would love to assist Stanley Boyd Elementary School in the continuation of being a spotlight school Thank you for considering my qualifications for this 2nd grade position I look forward to hearing from you in the near future to discuss my qualifications If you would like to contact me I can be reached at

current curriculum vita and three letters of recommendation As my CV indicates I received my Master s degree in ESL from Temple University s Tokyo school One of the unique aspects of this program is its Weekend Seminar series which invites experts from all over the world to do 14 hour seminars on an area of specialty While at Temple I took 9 credits of these seminars from people such as Richard Schmidt Sandra Savignon Teresa Pica and Paul Nation I feel that the variety of perspectives these seminars provided have helped make me a more rounded teacher and administrator I have eight years of experience teaching English in Japan to students aging from nine years old through senior citizens and at levels from beginner through advanced I have taught private lessons at language schools at a vocational school and at a university I primarily taught conversation but also had courses in writing and reading In all my conversation classes I strived to lead more students toward taking more responsibility for their learning by giving them more control over the topics and by teaching and practicing conversation and communication strategies In writing classes I focused on making students aware of aspects of creative writing and giving them opportunities to play with these aspects as well as working with them on writing essays on topics of their own choosing Finally in reading classes I tried to use real materials to the extent these were available for practicing different skills I also believe strongly in being a reflective practitioner and keep a teaching journal on a regular basis In addition I served three years as an administrator at the vocational school where I taught In this role I was in charge of hiring teachers curriculum development textbook selection scheduling and working with teachers to ensure that they were sharing lesson plans and teaching insights Finally I am also interested in materials development I am currently working on a writing textbook which I hope to send to a publisher in the next few months I would be happy to provide copies of textbook units or any other teaching materials you might find useful to help you make a decision Please let me

are some best practices and standards that the Career Center recommends Stand out from the crowd with high quality content and a clearly written error free document Teaching Resumes need to be aesthetically pleasing dense with relevant content and properly edited Aesthetics Always remember to have a classic professional resume This includes the font choice consistency an appropriate amount of white space length and overall appearance of the resume Teaching is a creative and innovative profession a teaching resume should be strictly professional Professional means there should not be any pictures colors or designs on your resume Those within the education field will immediately exclude you from potential candidates if your resume has poor aesthetics and is not professional Content While aesthetic mistakes can take you out of the running for a position the content of the resume is what will make you stand out from the crowd Experiences you choose to include in your teaching resume should be the most relevant to your target audience Accomplishment statements are intended to expand on your relevant experience and highlight your expertise Look to page 7 for more advice on accomplishment statements Editing Editing is a necessary component of resume writing that is often underutilized Editing is where you and others assure that content is accurate and aesthetics are pin point Have as many people proofread your resume as possible and stop by the Career Center for an extra set of eyes Look to page 12 for detail of Career Center services and workshops specifically for Teachers Reverse Chronological Order Within each section on the resume your experience must go in reverse chronological order meaning from new to old Accomplishment Statements Bullet Points Eliminate the pronoun I at the beginning of each bullet point as this is assumed Avoid introductory and wind up phrases such as My duties included and My responsibilities were Describe achievements rather than listing duties quantify outcomes whenever possible and be sure to highlight your proficiency in teaching and transferable skills More description on Accomplishment statements can be found on page 7 Length With rare exceptions student teachers and new teachers should keep their resume to 1 page If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume consider removing elements that are not closely related to teaching Ask yourself Will this experience enhance and support my future in education and teaching Margins Make your resume visually attractive by using an appropriate amount of whitespace to allow the reader s eye to rest Using 8 inch to 1 5 inch margins is standard practice Font Use a professional font that is easy to read Times New Roman Arial and Courier New are good choices A 10 12 point font size is recommended Consistency The formatting of a resume needs to be consistent For example if you choose to bold a job title make sure you bold every job title Also make sure that everything lines up neatly on the page Accuracy Your resume and all other job search materials must be 100% error free Be sure to carefully read through your resume checking grammar spelling and punctuation Editing a resume can always use another set of eyes have as many people proofread it as possible and come to the Career Center Paper Quality Use a high quality paper stock 24 32 lb 25% cotton fiber 8 1 2 x 11 when mailing your resume or bringing one to an interview Use the same paper for cover letters and thank you letters White ivory or light grey are good choices 3 Key Elements of

Education,Job & Internship Guide 16 17 Resume & Cover Letters A well crafted resume can set you apart from other candidates Strong resumes do more than summarize your educational background and work history they emphasize the results of your efforts and draw clear parallels between your skills and experience and an employer s needs The 5 Steps of Resume Development Step 1 Analyze the Position Description Read the position descriptions thoroughly and then highlight all of the keywords which indicate required and preferred skills abilities attributes and qualifications If an employer is looking for someone who is innovative punctual and attentive to detail consider using these same or similar words in your resume Because there are patterns within industries fields you may develop a strong resume template for a particular category of positions Along these lines it is also often appropriate to have multiple versions of your resume which may vary in content and structure depending on your target Step 2 Generate a List of Accomplishments Create an inventory of your accomplishments tasks you enjoyed doing did well and are proud of Include education training volunteer experience jobs projects travel group or team activities and skills There is no one formula for what to include in a resume Your resume should uniquely reflect you Focus on the outcomes of your efforts including skills you have developed Quantify your results if possible Don t sell yourself short Resumes are promotional tools Step 3 Identify Relevant Skill Areas Frame your experience so it focuses on skills and achievements that are desirable for that particular position field industry Make sure each accomplishment you list highlights a skill the employer is seeking often listed in the position responsibilities and qualifications Remember transferable skills skills you ve developed that can be used in many different settings If you are applying to your first position in a field industry consider in detail which skills you have developed and how from past experiences that may translate to this new environment Step 4 Write Descriptive Phrases Using action verbs see p 18 write concise phrases to describe experiences that demonstrate your relevant skills The accomplishments on your resume should ultimately be targeted to address an employer s needs Do your best to place them in order of relevance with the most relevant information as close as possible to the top Step 5 Choose a Format Within one page aim to develop a focused succinct marketing document that clearly communicates your value and relevant experience and skills 15 career berkeley edu A chronological resume is the most commonly used resume format Listing your experience in reverse chronological order with the most recent experiences first this resume format accommodates all industries and levels of experience and is preferred by the majority of employers and on campus recruiters Because a chronological resume presents your experience from most recent relevant to least recent relevant this format works especially well for students and entry to mid level applicants to demonstrate a vertical career progression See p 19 24 for examples of effective chronological resumes Although a chronological resume is often a safe bet for all levels established professionals who have multiple gaps and or unusually large gaps in their employment history who are aspiring to make a career change into a new industry or who want to promote a specific skillset may consider a skills functional resume format or a hybrid combination resume format as alternatives to the chronological resume format If appropriate established professionals may also move beyond a one page resume While resume templates may be tempting they tend to be inflexible also employers are often familiar with them and may perceive you as lacking ingenuity Find a format that works for you and use your own words to develop content that is unique to you The Resume Bullet How To Say It Resume bullets should describe your skills and accomplishments reflecting the order or priority that the employer has stated in their position description and requirements Write bullet points for jobs internships volunteer experiences and activities where you ve developed skills Consider how these bullet points highlight skills and experiences that match the position requirements Action oriented statements highlighting your accomplishments should use concrete language and could include What What task transferable skill did you perform Use action verbs See p 18 Why Why did you perform this task e g to fulfill a goal serve a need or make your organization company better How Specifically how did you perform this task What equipment tool software program or method did you use to accomplish this task Result What was the positive result you achieved or impact you made by performing this task quantitative or

be 2 3 full pages and a CV should be 3 5 pages long However based on your experiences career field and the position description it could be longer or shorter Whatever the case only print your document on one side of the paper and include your name and the page number at the top of each page Avoid using a resume or CV template This decreases your ability to personalize and make changes as your document evolves Your resume or CV should be well organized without spelling errors and easy to read An employer spends a short amount of time reading your document it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications To organize your document you may choose to use bold italics all caps indenting and bullets You will want to use these sparingly to emphasize the most important information Avoid pictures graphics non black ink shading and symbols instead of traditional round solid bullet points It is a good idea to start with a 1 inch margin on each side You can expand the margins if need be Font size should be between 10 12 point and you will want to choose easy to read font styles such as Times New Roman Arial or Garamond Keep font size and style consistent throughout your CV except for your name which should be a larger size Present your resume or CV on quality bond paper 20 pound choose white or off white to ensure your document is easy to read If you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your document directly keep the format simple when filling in required information If you are requested to submit your documents via email save your resume or CV and cover letter if applicable as attachments Include a brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose TIPS FOR RESUME AND CV WRITING Make sure that your resume or CV is a unique and personal document It is a great idea to look at examples of resumes or CVs but also important to make it your own There are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume or CV but there are also options and room for choice If you give your document to several people they may all give you different feedback Beyond some of our strongly suggested guidelines resumes and CVs are subjective Be 100% honest and factual Avoid abbreviations Organize your document so the most important information is at the top Do not include a work history Rather include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of skill Personal information such as marital status age ethnicity height and weight should not be included Avoid personal pronouns I my we and complete sentences to describe your experiences Start your statements with action verbs Always proofread your resume or CV Do not solely rely on spell check Some employers may eliminate candidates based on errors It is suggested that you tailor your resume or CV to the job description You may have more than one version of your document depending on the positions to which you are applying You may change the order of sections to list more relevant areas of your experience closer to the top Remember that your resume or CV is YOUR marketing tool Many times it is an employer s first impression of you It is also a work in progress that you will continually revise ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Visit to view our Resume Writing or Curriculum Vitae Workshops Visit the CSE Career Center Resource Center to

at a high level was the first thing I was drawn to while reviewing your website One sentence packed with a great deal of meaning The strides Stanley Boyd has made in math and reading to achieve 90% of your students passing their reading tests and 83% proficient or advanced in Math is something of which I hope to be a part It is for these reasons I would love the opportunity to join your community as a 2nd grade teacher In May 2013 I will be graduating from St Norbert College in De Pere Wisconsin with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Elementary Education and a minor in Language Arts My strengths in building connections with students faculty and parents using technology to effectively enhance the classroom and differentiate instruction based on the needs of my students are just a few of things I can offer to Stanley Boyd Some of the ways I build strong relationships with students faculty and parents is through attending after school events participating in a district meeting and opening lines of communication via newsletters e mails phone calls and conferences Two additional strengths I possess are the ability to use technology effectively and differentiate and engage students For example with my first grade students I used iPads during guided reading where high leveled students spelled sight words middle leveled students read sight words and lower leveled students traced letters while practicing letter sounds Another example is in 8th grade advanced Language Arts where students read a novel regarding utopias Students then reflected on their own utopia wrote about it and then presented using WebPages movies or podcast Finally at the end of the year students reflected on the unit choosing their favorite piece many chose to write about the technology I am excited about this opportunity to join your team of educators and bring my various strengths with me I would love to assist Stanley Boyd Elementary School in the continuation of being a spotlight school Thank you for considering my qualifications for this 2nd grade position I look forward to hearing from you in the near future to discuss my qualifications If you would like to contact me I can be reached at

education Through research writing and teaching I have contributed to our understanding of major changes in the academic landscape and organizational character of American higher education My work illuminates the dynamics of institutional change in several arenas what facilitates it and what impedes it within different types of colleges and universities and identifies implications for academic leaders who manage organizational change knowledge change and professional socialization Using theories and methods from sociology I analyze how organizational intellectual political economic and professional interests redefine the content structure conduct and relative legitimacy of academic fields Key studies include the emergence and institutionalization of interdisciplinary fields dynamics of professional socialization across disciplines tensions in restructuring during budget cuts and selective investment the ascendance of industry logic in public higher education 1975 2000 a pivotal era of changing societal expectations forces that promote and inhibit academic collaboration Serving in academic leadership roles has affirmed my passion for these areas and has inspired new inquiry

campus and community activities special courses and projects schools attended interests travel and skills All this will not end up in your final resume but you want to be sure you don t leave out anything important A professional resume is likely very different from your college application version Length One page is standard for most fields and for most students and recent graduates This is especially important for business technology or communications firms advertising or publishing for example Employers in many other fields appreciate a concise and attractive one page resume A longer resume is appropriate for certain applicants and fields For teaching a two page resume is acceptable if you have significant related experience For fellowships grants or research jobs you may need a Curriculum Vitae or C V A resume for federal jobs is often longer than one page Speak with a career advisor if you have any questions about what format is appropriate for your needs Format Avoid templates or resume wizards Your goal is to have your resume stand out in a positive way and template resumes often appear identical to those of many other applicants Arrange your education and experience in reverse chronological order present to past This lets your reader easily see your current and recent background You may also use categories relevant to your audience for example Public Relations Experience Laboratory Experience and so forth Some fields require specialized resume formats A C V may be needed for research science positions or fellowships For C V guidelines please see Curriculum Vitae for Academic or Research Roles Acting performance or studio arts majors should consult Resumes for Actors and Artists Note that many U S employers asking for a C V may actually want a resume 2 Writing a Resume Employers Will Read Use action verb phrases to describe your experiences Instead of Responsibilities included training staff say Trained five new staff A list of action verbs

S say Service Organizations of Smith It s OK to use postal abbreviations for states but be consistent Sections of a Resume NAME Put it at the top centered or flush left Use caps bold and a larger font to make it stand out CONTACT INFORMATION List your current address phone and email on one line saves space or blocked Also list a permanent or forwarding address if it s in your search region OBJECTIVE optional We suggest you omit an objective from your resume and state it in your cover letter SUMMARY or PROFILE optional More experienced applicants may begin with a summary geared to the reader For example Five years communications and marketing experience in non profit sector Skilled researcher writer and editor Excellent public speaking and workshop facilitation skills Strong fundraising background with special expertise in grant writing Experience recruiting training and motivating volunteers EDUCATION generally comes first for students and recent grads From present to past list school location degree date awarded or expected major minor and concentration Study away other degrees thesis related courses projects and research papers may be included GPA is required for

relevant to your reader Include skills under Education or as a separate category Add relevant licensing and certifications EXPERIENCE can include jobs internships volunteering extracurricular activities and course projects From present to past list title organization location and dates Put organizations first titles second if you like but do so consistently Use specific titles such as Administrative Intern rather than Intern if your supervisor approves Choose headers stressing experience in your target field for example Museum Experience ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE also called Supporting Experience is an optional category for content you d like to include but is less directly relevant to your reader You may use a second heading as described above ACTIVITIES INTERESTS SKILLS TRAVEL AFFILIATIONS Choose headings that work for the rest of your content Be specific Say Enjoy modern British fiction rather than Enjoy reading Listing memberships that reveal your race ethnicity religion political affiliation sexual orientation or gender identity may encourage or discourage employers from interviewing you Feel free to consult a career advisor about your resume content DO NOT INCLUDE the statement References Available on Request Instead prepare a separate page titled References for Your Name with your references names titles and contact info with permission to send if requested Personal statistics age height weight and a photograph are only appropriate for a performance resume Marital status is never included on a resume INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WISHING TO WORK IN THE US should use their Smith address and or a US address if you have one rather than an international address Do not include your current visa status or country of citizenship It is illegal for employers to ask about these topics in the US though they may ask whether you have work authorization or will require visa sponsorship in the future If you are a Permanent Resident we suggest including this in a final Activities and Additional Background section Questions Please see a career advisor about your resume and the international student advisor about work status regulations Making Your Resume Attractive and Easy to Read Select a font size and style that are easy to read We suggest 10 12 point size in familiar fonts such as Arial Times New Roman or Garamond Try a slightly larger font for headings and name Adjust the margins to fit your content 1 0 margins are typical but not a strict requirement Use capital letters bold type italics underlining bullets and spacing for emphasis Be consistent with spacing dates punctuation and order of information Details matter Proofread your resume carefully Don t rely on spell check Misspellings grammar and punctuation errors and inconsistencies make a poor first impression You may not be asked for an interview as a result For hard copy resumes use bond paper 24 # weight is suggested in white cream or gray Use the same paper for your letters and get matching envelopes If using a watermarked paper get the mark right side up Use a letter quality printer with a fresh cartridge Keep your resume polished and up to date Revise it as you gain new experiences or change directions The effort you put into this important marketing tool will be time well spent 4 Action Verb List The verbs listed below are only a few of the many

at a high level was the first thing I was drawn to while reviewing your website One sentence packed with a great deal of meaning The strides Stanley Boyd has made in math and reading to achieve 90% of your students passing their reading tests and 83% proficient or advanced in Math is something of which I hope to be a part It is for these reasons I would love the opportunity to join your community as a 2nd grade teacher In May 2013 I will be graduating from St Norbert College in De Pere Wisconsin with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Elementary Education and a minor in Language Arts My strengths in building connections with students faculty and parents using technology to effectively enhance the classroom and differentiate instruction based on the needs of my students are just a few of things I can offer to Stanley Boyd Some of the ways I build strong relationships with students faculty and parents is through attending after school events participating in a district meeting and opening lines of communication via newsletters e mails phone calls and conferences Two additional strengths I possess are the ability to use technology effectively and differentiate and engage students For example with my first grade students I used iPads during guided reading where high leveled students spelled sight words middle leveled students read sight words and lower leveled students traced letters while practicing letter sounds Another example is in 8th grade advanced Language Arts where students read a novel regarding utopias Students then reflected on their own utopia wrote about it and then presented using WebPages movies or podcast Finally at the end of the year students reflected on the unit choosing their favorite piece many chose to write about the technology I am excited about this opportunity to join your team of educators and bring my various strengths with me I would love to assist Stanley Boyd Elementary School in the continuation of being a spotlight school Thank you for considering my qualifications for this 2nd grade position I look forward to hearing from you in the near future to discuss my qualifications If you would like to contact me I can be reached at

resume III Transferable Skills & Action Verbs Page 5 Transferable skills are those that can be applied in a variety of industries and job functions Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a great place to start when composing your resume This list is a sampling of the types of skills you might highlight on your resume in addition to those skills that are more

emphasized starting with your most recent experiences to illustrate a progressive work history Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements under each position This resume type is recommended for people who have recently graduated with a bachelor s degree those who are staying within the same career field and candidates with few time gaps in their job history This type

Resources Page 14 2 I Resume Purpose Design & Mechanics The purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education experience and skills ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview When conceptualizing your resume think of it as a marketing tool rather than a simple work history as it is intended to promote you as the perfect candidate for the opportunity at hand Resume writing is an art not a science There is no one correct way to formulate a resume but there are some best practices and standards that the Career Center recommends Stand out from the crowd with high quality content and a clearly written error free document Sequence the information from most important to least important with regard to your career objective When constructing bullet points aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify the skills you possess and employers are seeking Length With a few rare exceptions when applying for internships or entry level jobs students should keep their resume to 1 page If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume consider removing elements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying Margins Make your resume visually attractive Use some whitespace to allow the reader s eye to rest Using 5 inch to 1 5 inch margins is recommended Font Use a font that is easy to read Times New Roman Arial and Courier New are good choices A 10 12 point font size is recommended Consistency Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume For example if you choose to bold a job title make sure you bold every job title Also make sure that all of your bullet points section headers dates etc line up neatly on the page Accuracy Your resume and all other job search materials must be 100% error free Be sure to carefully read through your resume checking grammar spelling and punctuation It is a good idea to have at least 2 3 people proofread it as well Be Accomplishment Orientated Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when you have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking Describe achievements rather than listing

points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the skill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement This allows a potential employer to more easily scan your resume for what he or she is seeking Make it Clear and Be Succinct Eliminate the pronoun I at the beginning of each bullet point as this is assumed Avoid introductory and wind up phrases such as My duties included and My responsibilities were Overall Appearance Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking Also consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less Make sure that your most important information stands out 3 II Key Elements of a Successful Resume Your First and Last Name Phone number Email address Street address City state & zip code

modeled arranged simplified enumerated involved modified assembled sought estimated joined performed assessed straightened figured judged planned assigned strategize financed Page 4 FORMATTING YOUR RESUME The length of your resume will depend on your level of experience and qualifications Generally a bachelors level candidate should stick to a one page resume If your resume is two pages only print on one side of the paper and your second page should include your name and Page 2 Avoid using a resume template This does not allow the opportunity to personalize and to make changes and your resume is an ever changing document Your resume should be well organized without spelling errors and easy to read An employer spends an average of 20 30 seconds scanning your resume it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications To organize your resume you may choose to use bold italics all caps indenting and bullets You will want to use these sparingly to emphasize the most important information Avoid pictures graphics non black ink shading and symbols instead of traditional round solid bullet points It is a good idea to start with a one inch margin on each side You can expand the margins if need be Your font size should be between 10 12 point and you will want to choose easy to read font styles such as Times New Roman Arial or Garamond Keep your font size and style consistent throughout your resume except for your name which should be a larger size Present your resume on quality bond paper 20 pound stick with white and off white to ensure your resume is easy to read If you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your resume directly keep the format simple when filling in the required information If you are requested to submit your resume via email save your resume and cover letter if applicable as attachments Include a brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose TIPS FOR RESUME WRITING Make sure that your resume is a unique and personal document It is a great idea to look at examples of resumes but also important to make it your own Please see the Resume Examples Binder in the Resource Center There are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume but there are also options and room for choice If you give your resume to several people they may all give you different feedback Beyond some of our strongly suggested guidelines resumes are subjective Be 100% honest and factual Avoid abbreviations Organize your resume so the most relevant information is at the top Do not include a work history Rather include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of skill Personal information such as marital status age height weight etc should not be included Avoid personal pronouns I my we and complete sentences to describe your experiences Start your statements with action verbs References are a separate document from your resume Reference documents should include your contact information as it appears on your resume List the name title company name address phone and email of each reference see example on Pg 9 Always proofread your resume Do not solely rely on spell check Some employers may eliminate candidates based on errors It is suggested to tailor your resume to the job description You may have more than one version of your resume depending on the positions you are applying for Employers may do a key word search of the resumes submitted to find those that meet the job requirements Remember that your resume is YOUR marketing tool Many times it is an employer s first impression of you It is also a work in progress that you will continually revise CURRICULUM VITAE CV A CV is a type of resume most commonly used to apply for research or faculty positions in an academic setting A CV is typically longer in length and provides more detail than a resume In addition to the basics that you would include on a resume it is common to include publications presentations research and teaching experiences grants fellowships and awards ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Visit to view our Resume Writing Workshop Visit the Resource Center

should use their Smith address and or a US address if you have one rather than an international address Do not include your current visa status or country of citizenship It is illegal for employers to

final Activities and Additional Background section Questions Please see a career advisor about your resume and the international student advisor about work status regulations Making Your Resume Attractive and Easy to Read Select a font size and style that are easy to read We suggest 10 12 point size in familiar fonts such as Arial Times New Roman or Garamond Try a slightly larger font for headings and name Adjust the margins to fit your content 1 0 margins are typical but not a strict requirement Use capital letters bold type italics underlining bullets and spacing for emphasis Be consistent with spacing dates punctuation and order of information Details matter Proofread your resume carefully Don t rely on spell check Misspellings grammar and punctuation errors and inconsistencies make a poor first impression You may not be asked for an interview as a result For hard copy resumes use bond paper 24 # weight is suggested in white cream or gray Use the same paper for your letters and get matching envelopes If using a watermarked paper get the mark right side up Use a letter quality printer with a fresh cartridge Keep your resume polished and up to date Revise it as you gain new experiences or change directions The effort you put into this important marketing tool will be time well spent 4 Action Verb List The verbs listed below are only a few of the many

Cover Letters The First Impression An employer s first impression of you is often your cover letter so it must engage their attention quickly and convince them to take the time to read your resume Your cover letter needs to show what makes you a great fit for the position It is not sufficient to say you have the skills required for the position or are interested in it First research the field and organization Go beyond the website use press releases journal news articles annual reports Google LexisNexis and informational interviews with alums and others Knowledge of the organization shows your initiative and enthusiasm for working there Review the job description notice the skills sought and field specific terms used Identify specific examples from your resume that demonstrate how you ve used the skills the employer wants Stress accomplishments and results rather than simply listing your day to day responsibilities Whenever possible address your letter to an actual person not To Whom it May Concern Phone or email to get the recipient s name and title if it s not included in the position description If you can t get a name use a title such as Dear Director or Dear Internship Coordinator The cover letter is a sample of your writing and communication skills It must be clear concise and free of spelling grammar or punctuation errors Keep it simple Dense academic language or slang are inappropriate this is a business letter Tailor each cover letter Employers may receive dozens or even hundreds of applications for any given position Careful research relevant examples and specific reasons why this position and this organization interest you will help distinguish your application Framing Your Story Questions to Guide Your Cover Letter Use the following to generate content for your cover letter Though it need not answer every question a great letter will address many of these items and show you ve considered the others Why are you interested in this position This organization This field industry For what position are you applying What do you know about the organization its work clients customers products that especially interests you What do you feel distinguishes this organization from its peers What specific skills and knowledge is the employer seeking for this position How have your prior experiences influenced your interest in this position organization field In what ways have your accomplishments during your prior experiences extracurricular volunteer work other prepared you to excel in this position What aspects of your academic experience will help you succeed in this position Compared to other applicants how might you be uniquely qualified for the position How will the organization benefit from hiring you Having difficulty answering any of these questions Revisiting the job description further research and clarifying your skills and interests may help 6 Cover Letter Format Use standard business letter format for your letter Refer to the following page for guidelines on address format greeting and closing and spacing A cover letter should be no more than one page Keep the paragraphs short and easy to read Use a 10 12 point font size in the same font style as your resume Set the margins so the letter is visually balanced on the page 1 is standard For hard copy applications use matching resume weight paper and envelopes and sign your letter in black ink If using stationery with a watermark be sure it is facing the correct way Emailing Cover Letters and Resumes Always follow an employer s preference when

Engineering,Resumes for Engineers What is a resume A resume is a marketing brochure about you It describes your skills experience paid and or unpaid and your education The purpose of an effective resume is to get you an interview Is one resume good for all jobs Your job search materials should be customized for each position If your search is focused on one type of position a single version of your resume may be fine along with a cover letter that is tailored to your employment target If you re applying to a wider range of positions you may need to revise your resume in addition to creating a new cover letter This customization is essential to your marketing and requires research about the organization and industry What is a chronological resume The chronological resume is a commonly used format for undergraduate students The experience section of a chronological resume includes your positions listed in reverse chronological order beginning with your most recent position and working backwards Essential data includes name of organization location your title and dates of employment involvement This is followed by several bullets describing your skills and achievements How is an engineering resume different than a liberal arts resume An engineering resume may include specialized section headings such as Technical Skills Engineering Experience Lab Experience Academic

Engineering,Resumes for Engineers What is a resume A resume is a marketing brochure about you It describes your skills experience paid and or unpaid and your education The purpose of an effective resume is to get you an interview Is one resume good for all jobs Your job search materials should be customized for each position If your search is focused on one type of position a single version of your resume may be fine along with a cover letter that is tailored to your employment target If you re applying to a wider range of positions you may need to revise your resume in addition to creating a new cover letter This customization is essential to your marketing and requires research about the organization and industry What is a chronological resume The chronological resume is a commonly used format for undergraduate students The experience section of a chronological resume includes your positions listed in reverse chronological order beginning with your most recent position and working backwards Essential data includes name of organization location your title and dates of employment involvement This is followed by several bullets describing your skills and achievements How is an engineering resume different than a liberal arts resume An engineering resume may include specialized section headings such as Technical Skills Engineering Experience Lab Experience Academic Experience Lab Skills Research Relevant Courses Projects or Design Projects An engineer often includes academic work including a list of courses and relevant project work This academic experience might be listed before work experience if they have not yet interned or worked in an engineering environment Technical skills may also be listed at the top of the resume if required by the position What else do I need to know about resumes Survive the human scan Resumes get less than 30 seconds of an employer s time Survive the electronic scan Make sure you have used appropriate jargon and keywords for your field Capture your reader s attention by keeping your resume to a single easily skimmable page Check with a Career Advisor about exceptions to the one page rule Use good quality paper in colors such as white off white or neutral if submitting hard copy Check for typos spelling errors and grammar usage Include a customized cover letter that demonstrates how you match the employer s requirements How do I email my resume Email your resume and cover letter as one attachment PDF format with your cover letter as page 1 and resume as page 2 When emailing your documents to employers include your first initial and last name in the title of the document When creating an appropriate subject line for your email use your name and the position to which you re applying For

Engineering,HOW TO WRITE A PROFESSIONAL RESUME RESUME TIPS The following tips are suggestions that you should consider when writing and sending your resume to prospective employers Use white or light colored paper in standard size 8 x 11 inches Many office supply stores sell resume paper Be sure to include a cover letter with mailed and emailed resumes When you email a resume and cover letter create a short introduction to use as your email body The resume should be easy to read crisp and have a consistent format Always keep your resume up to date Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems ATS which scan resumes for key words and themes that match the job description These words identify skills that the company is looking for to fill specific job postings However due to the use of this software there are specific ways a resume should be formatted so that it will scan properly in to the company s system Do not use a template invisible text boxes special graphics color or shading Always use a blank Microsoft Word document to create a text only version of your resume for online submissions Always submit your resume in a pdf format and save more creative versions of your resume to hand to an employer in person Use standard non decorative fonts in black ink only Font sizes should be 14 16pt for your name and 10 12pt for the body of your resume Margins should be equally set between 6 1 inch on all sides Avoid folding or stapling your resume If your resume is more than one page create a header and or footer with your name contact information and page number Key words describe skills using nouns and action verbs and are very important in your resume Companies usually indicate key skills they are looking for in the job posting Use synonyms in your resume if you use the word Attorney also use the word Lawyer Do not use I me my or other personal pronouns simply begin statements with strong action verbs to describe what you did Key words = experience + knowledge be honest and do not exaggerate your skills Always proofread your resume before you send it OBJECTIVES An objective statement is a one or two line statement of your career or job search goal It is used in place of a longer summary likely when a candidate has little to no experience related to their target position Your objective should be specific to the type of position or field that you re

Engineering,your resume and try to determine if they have a position that would work for you An objective statement that says you want a position that offers growth and advancement and the opportunity to expand on your education and training tells an employer that you are looking for what they can do for you not what you can do for them EDUCATION OR EXPERIENCE What to put first If your education is more pertinent to the work you are seeking than your employment history list your education first If your education is very pertinent to the job you may wish to list specific course titles that you have completed that are directly related to the work you would be doing If your employment history is more pertinent it should be listed first on your resume ACADEMIC BACKGROUND Your academic background should be included in the resume with your most recently obtained degree or most advanced degree listed first The usual method is to list the school name city and state degree earned and date of graduation If you are currently enrolled in school you can list your projected date of graduation If you have received honors at school were elected class president or supported yourself through college you can add those achievements to your resume under a heading such as Honors and Achievements If you feel that some of your coursework will be valuable to you on the job you may want a heading called Major Coursework or Pertinent Coursework where you would list specific classes by name If the name of the course does not make it obvious what the content of the course was you may want to add this information in parentheses OTHER POSSIBLE TOPIC OR SKILL HEADINGS Equipment Computer Expertise Qualifications Highlights Summary Language Competency Licenses Certificates Additional Training Professional Affiliations Strengths Accomplishments Achievements REFERENCES There are mixed opinions as to whether or not to have a references notation on your resume If you are squeezed for space it is probably in your best interest to use the space to sell yourself to the employer On the other hand if you are just starting out in the job market there is no harm in noting that you do have references available on your resume You should have references available to hand to the employer immediately and may want to include them with your resume as part of your application packet References are usually the last heading on your resume and are usually listed as Available upon Request References Attached Additional References Available Upon Request or References and Portfolio Available Upon Request Be sure that you have them typed and ready to hand out References should not be listed individually on the resume itself but rather on a separate sheet with an indication as to your relationship to the person you are listing as a reference For work related references you might list company presidents managers supervisors co workers or clients Personal references can include friends faculty landlords etc Providing a list of references works as long as a reference is still available at your prior employer A letter of recommendation gives you a hedge against the day that your reference moves on and you can no longer refer potential employers to them Be sure that you ask a person if they are willing to be a reference for you before you list them as a reference Check with your listed references regularly to be sure that they are still available 4 LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION If possible get a written letter of recommendation from as many people as possible before you leave a job or soon afterwards A written recommendation is a known quantity You can never be sure what someone says about you in a verbal recommendation Written letters of recommendation may be attached to a resume or given to a potential employer separately with your references A letter of recommendation can speak about you in more glowing terms than you would feel comfortable describing yourself Many employers want to speak to a reference rather than read a letter of recommendation They distrust letters of recommendation knowing that you would be unlikely to provide a less than glowing one and want to talk to your reference directly or even circumvent your listed references and speak to other people who may have worked with you at the company Always check with your references before listing them on an application to be sure that they are still available and willing to act as a reference for you If you are uneasy about what your references may be saying about you you can hire a reference checking service or have a friend act as a potential employer and call the reference you are concerned about If you choose to go this route give them a script to work from Many companies have a reference policy and will only verify that you were an employee and the dates that you worked for that company WHAT NOT TO PUT IN YOUR RESUME Do not put your age sex marital status number of children religious affiliation ethnic origin height weight or health status This information may be used to discriminate against you and is illegal for employers to ask prior to hiring you It is also advisable not to list political or professional affiliations unless they are directly job related Do not include past salaries or anticipated starting salary This information may be requested by an employer however the consensus with employment professionals is that it is not in your best interest to include the information in writing You have to choose whether or not you feel you background is strong enough that they will want to speak to you without this information If you include a section of hobbies or extracurricular activities it is recommended that you leave out any activities that could be considered physically hazardous Employers want you on the job not recovering from your recreational activities REMEMBER Your resume should be free of spelling grammatical and typographical errors Have it proof read Never assume that a computer spell check will find all errors Keep it simple Do not use brightly colored paper or a variety of graphics or fonts or font sizes Have your resume printed on good quality rag bond paper Have you references list and letters of recommendation and cover letter printed on the same paper as your resume If possible avoid plain white paper If your resume will be scanned not a usual occurrence in Santa Cruz but common in Silicon Valley be sure to provide a scanner friendly version If you are doing a web based resume be sure any links to or from that web link are professional Do not post your picture on line as part of your on line resume Do not send out a resume that has cross outs or things handwritten in Take the time to do it right 5 KEY WORDS FOR RESUME PREPARATION Ability Accelerated Accomplished Accurate Achieved Active Adapted Adjusted Administer Advertised Advised Aggressive Ambitions Analyze Analytical

page 42 Other Tips RESUME FORMATS There is no single way to format your resume The format you choose should present your strengths clearly See sample formats and layouts on pages 27 41 Chronological Format This format is most familiar to employers and most commonly used by Stanford students This style of resume presents your experience and education in reverse chronological sequence starting with the most recent Date job title organization s name location and a description of your activities are listed as part of the experience section This format is simple straightforward and especially useful for anyone with a history of directly relevant experience Functional Skills Format This format focuses on areas of skill and can be effective in conveying your strengths to an employer although many employers are not as familiar with this format as with the chronological or combination format This style of resume draws attention to Combination Format This format is appropriate when you have relevant work experience for each of several skill areas and combines both the chronological and functional formats This style allows you to group your experiences or key selling points together by functional areas such as Research Experience and Teaching Experience and then list those experiences in reverse chronological order within each section It is also a familiar format to employers SUBMITTING RESUMES ELECTRONICALLY Email Send your resume as an attached file and paste the text into the body of the email Having your resume in the body of the email as well as an attachment gives the employer the opportunity to see your resume in the event they cannot open your attachment or do not take the time Use a simple format for the resume you put in the body of the email left justified no bold no italics no underlines no tabs See Sample Electronic Resume on page 42 Don t forget to include a cover letter in the body of the email too If you have your resume in a PDF file you can also attach that with your email The PDF version will allow the employer the opportunity to see your resume in an attractive format utilizing bold and underlines When emailing resume files name them so the employer can easily identify them as your resume Last name followed by first name and the word resume is most helpful Resume Scanning Companies receiving large quantities of resumes may scan each resume as an image and then sort the image into recognizable letters words and symbols These scanned images are entered into a database and then searched for keywords which indicate skills education and knowledge areas the employer is seeking Left justify all text and avoid using underlining italics bullets bold and columns Every occupation and career field has its own jargon acronyms and buzzwords these are helpful key words to use If you are responding to a job listing use words from the job listing in your resume and cover letter CDC RESOURCES Titles available in the CDC Resource

appropriate for freshmen and sophomores to include high school experiences However important high school experiences that have some relevance to your job objective may be appropriate for upper classmen For International Students it is sometimes a disadvantage to include your non immigrant visa status or permanent address if outside the U S on your resume Usually your visa status should be discussed later during the interview If you have obtained permanent residency or U S citizenship it might be to your advantage to list the information on your resume accomplishments and highlights your skills by function rather than your work experience and is more commonly used by people with very little formal work experience or are returning to the workplace after being away or otherwise

Engineering,RESUME WRITING Tips for resume formatting and content with samples from alumni A resume is a brief concise document that presents and effectively sells your most relevant and positive credentials for employment admission to graduate school consideration for a scholarship or fellowship or other professional purpose An employer will usually spend 15 to 30 seconds reviewing your resume so the content of your resume must be clear concise and targeted to the type of job for which you are applying Preparation Resumes should highlight skills and accomplishments that meet employer qualifications excluding irrelevant information and experiences Well designed resumes will be visually appealing and free from any spelling typographical punctuation or grammatical errors All resumes should be written concisely in an organized format that presents the most important information first Employers who read individual resumes spend very little time on each resume Many large employers now use software programs Applicant Tracking Systems to assist them with this initial review If your resume has a typo or grammatical error it will probably jump off the page to an employer and this is a way to weed you out of a candidate pool Your resume may be the only chance you get to make an impression so make it a good one Constructing Your Resume Contact information Begin your resume with your name by capitalizing and using bold type Include street address city state and zip code Include a phone number s where you can be reached Include your e mail address Objective Optional The purpose of the objective statement is to inform the employer of your career goals and targeted interests Objectives are no longer as widely used as they once were as employers expect you to cover the same information in more detail in the cover letter If you would like to include an objective review the samples on the last page of this handout A career job objective may be advantageous when You want to specify your interests and where you would fit in the organization You want to present the impression of a focused self confident person A career job objective is not advantageous when it is Too broad and meaningless reflecting indecision Too exclusive eliminating you from jobs for which you might be considered Qualifications or Experience Summary Optional A summary of qualifications can condense an extensive background by emphasizing experiences and accomplishments in brief keyword phrases The qualifications summary is accomplishment oriented and provides an overview of your work experience It can also serve to summarize relevant academic volunteer and leadership experience for those who have limited work experience A summary is most appropriate for someone with substantial experience someone who is changing careers and wants to demonstrate transferable skills or someone with a varied background They re most often used by graduate students and working professionals Education If your education relates to your objective and is within the past three years it should be the first section If not education should follow the work experience section of your resume In reverse chronological order this section includes the schools you have attended dates of graduation or dates of attendance as well as degrees sought or completed Other information that might be included related coursework scholarships and honors and special projects e g research projects teaching Start with your most recent degree or the program in which you are currently enrolled List other degrees or relevant education in reverse chronological order Highlight key info by using bold type or capital letters Most students begin with the university followed by the location degree and graduation date You can consider listing your degree before the name of the university as well Should I include my GPA If you are uncertain about including your GPA ask a Career Services advisor for recommendations based on your individual circumstances Within this section you may also want to highlight coursework research or a study abroad experience Consider listing relevant coursework under the appropriate degree You may want to describe thesis research or design projects Note You may want to have a separate Related Course Projects section see examples in this handout Chronological Format In the chronological resume job history is organized chronologically with the most recent job listed first Job titles and employers are emphasized and duties and accomplishments are described in detail Begin with your current most recent position and work backward chronologically Devote more space to relevant employment experiences If your job titles relate to your current job objective start each position description with job titles If not begin with the organization Follow job title and organizational information with the organization s city and state Use the first and last month or semester terms such as Fall Spring and Summer and year to describe dates of employment Describe experiences related to the position you re applying for in detail Summarize earlier positions unless relevant to your objective Within each listed position stress the major accomplishments and responsibilities that demonstrate your competency Resume Checklist The following checklist has been designed to assist you in writing your resume This checklist reflects the expertise of the Career Center staff developed through critiquing thousands of resumes discussing selection criteria with numerous

Tips 7 Information that appears on most resumes Sample Resumes 8 9 10 17 The Cover Letter Examples of Cover Letters Referral from Faculty Member or Other 18 19 Answer to a Newspaper Ad 20 Direct Solicitation to an Organization 21 1 INTRODUCTION Do you want an interesting challenging well paid position when you graduate Does the idea of securing an entry level job with good long term career growth appeal to you If so act now There is a lot that you can do to make such a position become a reality Studies consistently show that the Number One factor in helping college graduates transition to meaningful paid positions is career related experience Career related experience can be gained in a variety of ways These include internships paid or unpaid cooperative education summer positions voluntary experience and part time jobs All work experience is valuable but experience directly related to one s long term career goals is the most meaningful This booklet is designed to help you write a resume that can be used while you are still an undergraduate Hopefully a good resume will help you obtain career related experience before you graduate 2 INTERNSHIPS At the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown the Office of Career Services has been designated as the initial point of contact for internships Employers who are seeking interns from UPJ are directed to this office They work closely with academic departments and faculty to refer students to employers If you are interested in an internship talk to your faculty advisor or visit the Career Services Office COOPERATIVE EDUCATION Cooperative Education is a formalized program where students alternate between semesters of full time school and semesters of full time work Co op students normally have more than one semester of co op work experience prior to graduation The University s School of Engineering in Pittsburgh has a Cooperative Education program through which UPJ s Engineering Technology students can be placed in co op positions ET students who are interested in co op should see their faculty advisor 3 THE BIG S REFERRAL SYSTEM The Big S program is a computerized job referral system developed by Career Services to notify UPJ students of part time and summer job opportunities After job openings are received in the Career Services Office they are matched to the fields of interest which are listed on the registration form Once matches are made students are then sent a notice with a description of the job If the student is interested in the position it is up to him her to contact the employer usually by sending a resume and cover letter Register with the Big S in Career Services if you want to receive notices about part time and summer positions 4 WHERE DO I LOOK FOR CAREER RELATED POSITIONS By referring to the directories seniors use in their full time job hunt you can start a list of all the companies for which you would most like to work for Most of the companies listed in directories are very large and or nationwide but obviously they are also the companies that are able to conduct large summer hiring programs Because smaller companies do not hire in great volume it can be more difficult to seek them out but do not rule them out A good rule to follow is don t leave any stone unturned Joe Schmo s Fish Market may need summer help to balance the books A good place to look for summer positions is with the state or the federal government There are a vast number of opportunities in the many agencies A good way to find out about these opportunities would be to check the websites and best ways to find summer employment are to research write letters talk to as many people as you can and distribute your resume as much as possible Remember Career Services can provide you with a lot of good resources It s to your advantage to utilize this office And also even if you don t get a position that provides experience in your profession you can gain valuable communication and organizational skills simply by delivering pizzas or waiting tables 5 WHERE DO I LOOK FOR A SUMMER JOB Many people don t realize that they have an effective job referral system at their fingertips This network uses no forms costs nothing and has an amazing success rate as high as 80 percent All you need to do to take advantage of this job network is get the word out to friends relatives professors etc Many jobs are found just by asking people you know to keep an eye out for job openings Give your resume to these people Ask them to circulate it to those who might need a person with a background like yours When picking up and dropping off an application or a resume it s always best to do these things in person look sharp If a person s appearance is sloppy and unkempt a potential employer will take an application and file it away under NO WAY If the position requires that you complete an application fill it out in blue or black ink NEATLY The appearance and condition of your application could tell a great deal about you to an employer A great looking application may not get you a job but a sloppy application will most certainly stop you from being hired If you are asked to interview for a position make sure you are dressed properly Neatness counts in any interview so try to look your best Remove any facial piercing cover tattoos and avoid extreme hairdos and clothing Men should have facial hair neatly groomed Women should use make up conservatively When interviewing for professional positions professional attire is expected 6 HOW RESUMES FOR UNDERGRADUATES DIFFER FROM THOSE OF SENIORS AND ALUMNI Whereas college graduates typically do not include information from their high school years on their resumes undergraduates may and normally do use such information The younger you are the more likely it is that you will use information from your high school years Your objective if you include one should say that you are seeking a summer position a part time job an internship or a co op position You may choose to include your QPA if it is average or above It may help to list the courses that you have taken in high school or college that relate to the position for which you are applying It is generally advisable to list your computer skills Even though career related experience is most significant all work experience is valuable If you mowed lawns worked in fast food baby sat etcetera don t shy away from putting it on your resume Your activities and interests can be a real asset They can display a great deal about you They show how active you are how willing you are to serve others and frequently indicate leadership traits and communication and organizational skills You should have at least three references Those that you list as references should not be personal friends or family members Teachers professors and supervisors from places at which you worked make the best references List their name title place of employment address and telephone number References are normally typed on a separate sheet of paper and given to the employer upon request 7 RESUME WRITING TIPS Writing a resume can be a daunting experience The following is a list of tips compiled from the advice of employers career counselors and recent graduates whose resumes helped them land meaningful employment Pay careful attention to spelling punctuation grammar and style Proofread your resume carefully using a dictionary and stylebook and have several other people proofread it as well Organize information in a logical fashion Keep descriptions clear and to the point Confine your information to one page Use a simple easy to read font Use good quality white or off white bond paper Include as much work experience as possible even if it doesn t obviously relate to the job you re seeking Tailor your information to the job you re seeking Seek help at your career services center For more information on preparing a resume and other jobsearch ideas visit your career center National Association of Colleges and Employers 8 INFORMATION THAT APPEARS ON MOST RESUMES 1 Personal Information Name Campus Permanent Addresses Telephone Numbers and an E mail Address 2 *Employment Goals This is normally called the Career Objective or simply Objective Describe the type of work you desire The objective should reflect your short range plans For those with little or no full time work experience the development of a concisely described job objective may be the most difficult task in compiling a resume If you find that a specific career objective is too confining or doesn t meet your needs there are options available a You may decide to write your objectives in functional terms that describe the type of work activities you prefer instead of a description or title b Eliminate the employment goal section on your resume and incorporate your objective in your cover letter c Have several resumes with different objectives that you would send to the appropriate employers 3 Education Name of College s Location Dates Degree s Major s Quality Point Average* Honors and perhaps courses of particular value if they are related to employment for which you are applying Whereas college graduates typically do not include high school background undergraduates frequently find it advantageous to do so 4 Skills You may decide to include a section that lists your computer skills foreign languages licenses CPR commercial driving etc and other skills 5 Experience Part time employment summer employment applicable college projects internships volunteer work This section may be divided into three areas career related experience part time employment and summer experience For undergraduates with little or no full time professional level work experience it is very important to include part time and summer jobs even if the type of work has no bearing on academic or career plans Remember that career related experience is most valuable but a proven track record of other successful experience also makes you a more attractive candidate NOTE It is much more important to emphasize what your experiences were description explanation rather than when and where dates places 6 Military Service For those who have completed military obligations the dates of active duty and rank upon discharge should be included When appropriate include a brief description of duties and responsibilities particularly if the experience relates to future employment If you do not have any military experience omit this section 9 7 Activities and Interests These include extra curricular college and or community experiences and any leadership positions A brief listing of hobbies or avocations is acceptable Teacher education candidates should include all experiences working with children and adolescents Candidates for teaching positions might choose to include their own high school activities 8 *References List 3 or 4 persons Give name professional title business address and business phone These are normally listed on a separate sheet of paper If you decide not to list your references on your resume you could indicate that References are available upon request Do not use personal friends and relatives as references Teachers faculty and former supervisors make the best references * indicates optional Please Note Traditional advice has been to use action verbs when writing resumes and cover letters A list of action verbs you might consider using in your resume is provided in the back of this booklet Although the use of action verbs is still considered important you also should be aware of a recent trend Many large organizations are using computers to do the first scanning of resumes When scanned these computers can quickly review thousands of resumes However be aware that they normally scan for nouns not verbs Action verbs may have a greater effect when a human being does the first scanning of your resume but verbs may not impress a computer In essence both action verbs and important descriptive nouns that describe your qualifications such as titles or positions are important 10 SAMPLE RESUMES Please use the following resumes as examples only Look at all the resumes before you begin to construct your own Your resume will serve you best if it is unique and highlights your own personal qualifications Choosing a format that you like and then blending bits and pieces of a variety of examples will make your resume appear as if it is original Resumes copied from somebody else or produced from a template are normally not as effective as original resumes 11 Duncan Donaldson Duncan444@upj com Home Address 84 Trueman Avenue Altoona PA 15947 814 555 8444 Campus Address P O Box

Career Advisor Program hours by calling the Career Center at 312 362 8437 Loop Campus or 773 325 7431 Lincoln Park Campus Contents I Resume Purpose Design & Mechanics Page 3 II Key Elements of a Successful Resumes Page 4 This document is intended to guide you in creating your resume by outlining important types of information to include and tips for doing so in a professional and persuasive manner Please note this is not intended as a template and the format employed may or may not best represent you Consider meeting with a Peer Career Advisor to discuss how you might best layout your own resume III Transferable Skills & Action Verbs Page 5 Transferable skills are those that can be applied in a variety of industries and job functions Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a great place to start when composing your resume This list is a sampling of the types of skills you might highlight on your resume in addition to those skills that are more specific to your major intended industry or job function A sampling of action verbs is also included on this page Be sure to use strong action verbs to begin each of your bulleted statements previewing the skill to be exemplified through the accomplishment statement IV Chronological Resume Samples Pages 6 11 In this most commonly accepted resume format job titles and employers are emphasized starting with your most recent experiences to illustrate a progressive work history Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements under each position This resume type is recommended for people who have recently graduated with a bachelor s degree those who are staying within the same career field and candidates with few time gaps in their job history This type is most often preferred by employers because it is easy to scan highlights job titles employers and dates and clearly ties candidates skills and accomplishments to their work histories V Functional & Combination Resume Samples Pages 12 13 This format is an option for candidates who have changed employers frequently have gaps in their employment history or are hoping to transition to a new industry or unrelated job function Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight transferable skills placing less emphasis on employment dates job titles and employers VI Additional Career Center Resume Resources Page 14 2 I Resume Purpose Design & Mechanics The purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education experience and skills ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview When conceptualizing your resume think of it as a marketing tool rather than a simple work history as it is intended to promote you as the perfect candidate for the opportunity at hand Resume writing is an art not a science There is no one correct way to formulate a resume but there are some best practices and standards that the Career Center recommends Stand out from the crowd with high quality content and a clearly written error free document Sequence the information from most important to least important with regard to your career objective When constructing bullet points aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify the skills you possess and employers are seeking Length With a few rare exceptions when applying for internships or entry level jobs students should keep their resume to 1 page If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume consider removing elements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying Margins Make your resume visually attractive Use some whitespace to allow the reader s eye to rest Using 5 inch to 1 5 inch margins is recommended Font Use a font that is easy to read Times New Roman Arial and Courier New are good choices A 10 12 point font size is recommended Consistency Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume For example if you choose to bold a job title make sure you bold every job title Also make sure that all of your bullet points section headers dates etc line up neatly on the page Accuracy Your resume and all other job search materials must be 100% error free Be sure to carefully read through your resume checking grammar spelling and punctuation It is a good idea to have at least 2 3 people proofread it as well Be Accomplishment Orientated Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when you have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking Describe achievements rather than listing duties quantify outcomes whenever possible and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical industry or job function specific and transferable skills Use Action Verbs Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the skill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement This allows a potential employer to more easily scan your resume for what he or she is seeking Make it Clear and Be Succinct Eliminate the pronoun I at the beginning of each bullet point as this is assumed Avoid introductory and wind up phrases such as My duties included and My responsibilities were Overall Appearance Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking Also consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less Make sure that your most important information stands out 3 II Key Elements of a Successful Resume Your First and Last Name Phone number Email address Street address City state & zip code

resume cover letter and interview Over the years you have developed many skills through your coursework extracurricular activities and life experiences Review the list below and identify which transferrable skills you have and reflect on how you acquired these skills Use this information when creating your resume to describe your experiences and the skills gained from these experiences For example if you have researched a topic for class and then wrote edited and presented a final research paper in front of your peers you have used skills gathering information writing problem solving presenting which are not limited to that specific academic discipline but are transferable to many occupations Research and planning Human relations Organizing management and leadership Work survival The skillful expression and interpretation of knowledge and ideas The search for specific knowledge and the ability to conceptualize future needs and solutions The use of interpersonal skills for

planned assigned strategize financed Page 4 FORMATTING YOUR RESUME OR CV The length of your resume or CV will depend on your level of experience and qualifications Generally a graduate resume should be 2 3 full pages and a CV should be 3 5 pages long However based on your experiences career field and the position description it could be longer or shorter Whatever the case only print your document on one side of the paper and include your name and the page number at the top of each page Avoid using a resume or CV template This decreases your ability to personalize and make changes as your document evolves Your resume or CV should be well organized without spelling errors and easy to read An employer spends a short amount of time reading your document it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications To organize your document you may choose to use bold italics all caps indenting and bullets You will want to use these sparingly to emphasize the most important information Avoid pictures graphics non black ink shading and symbols instead of traditional round solid bullet points It is a good idea to start with a 1 inch margin on each side You can expand the margins if need be Font size should be between 10 12 point and you will want to choose easy to read font styles such as Times New Roman Arial or Garamond Keep font size and style consistent throughout your CV except for your name which should be a larger size Present your resume or CV on quality bond paper 20 pound choose white or off white to ensure your document is easy to read If you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your document directly keep the format simple when filling in required information If you are requested to submit your documents via email save your resume or CV and cover letter if applicable as attachments Include a brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose TIPS FOR RESUME AND CV WRITING Make sure that your resume or CV is a unique and personal document It is a great idea to look at examples of resumes or CVs but also important to make it your own There are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume or CV but there are also options and room for choice If you give your document to several people they may all give you different feedback Beyond some of our strongly suggested guidelines resumes and CVs are subjective Be 100% honest and factual Avoid abbreviations Organize your document so the most important information is at the top Do not include a work history Rather include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of skill Personal information such as marital status age ethnicity height and weight should not be included Avoid personal pronouns I my we and complete sentences to describe your experiences Start your statements with action verbs Always proofread your resume or CV Do not solely rely on spell check Some employers may eliminate candidates based on errors It is suggested that you tailor your resume or CV to the job description You may have more than one version of your document depending on the positions to which you are applying You may change the order of sections to list more relevant areas of your experience closer to the top Remember that your resume or CV is YOUR marketing tool Many times it is an employer s first impression of you It is also a work in progress that you will continually revise ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Visit to view our Resume Writing or Curriculum Vitae Workshops Visit the CSE Career Center Resource Center to view our Resume Examples Binder and related books Have your resume or CV reviewed by a CSE Career Counselor You can email to ccse@umn edu If you d like to meet with a CSE Career Counselor to discuss

BSP allowed the customer to use a number of COTS commercially off the shelf components that drastically reduced the time to marked especially since many libraries useful for robotics applications are readily available for Linux platforms like vision libraries Ability to port languages like python perl etc which can be readily done on linux but is extremely time consuming on other real time

Engineering,RESUME WRITING Tips for resume formatting and content with samples from alumni A resume is a brief concise document that presents and effectively sells your most relevant and positive credentials for employment admission to graduate school consideration for a scholarship or fellowship or other professional purpose An employer will usually spend 15 to 30 seconds reviewing your resume so the content of your resume must be clear concise and targeted to the type of job for which you are applying Preparation Resumes should highlight skills and accomplishments that meet employer qualifications excluding irrelevant information and experiences Well designed resumes will be visually appealing and free from any spelling typographical punctuation or grammatical errors All resumes should be written concisely in an organized format that presents the most important information first Employers who read individual resumes spend very little time on each resume Many large employers now use software programs Applicant Tracking Systems to assist them with this initial review If your resume has a typo or grammatical error it will probably jump off the page to an employer and this is a way to weed you out of a candidate pool Your resume may be the only chance you get to make an impression so make it a good one Constructing Your Resume Contact information Begin your resume with your name by capitalizing and using bold type Include street address city state and zip code Include a phone number s where you can be reached Include your e mail address Objective Optional The purpose of the objective statement is to inform the employer of your career goals and targeted interests Objectives are no longer as widely used as they once were as employers expect you to cover the same information in more detail in the cover letter If you would like to include an objective review the samples on the last page of this handout A career job objective may be advantageous when You want to specify your interests and where you would fit in the organization You want to present the impression of a focused self confident person A career job objective is not advantageous when it is Too broad and meaningless reflecting indecision Too exclusive eliminating you from jobs for which you might be considered Qualifications or Experience Summary Optional A summary of qualifications can condense an extensive background by emphasizing experiences and accomplishments in brief keyword phrases The qualifications summary is accomplishment oriented and provides an overview of your work experience It can also serve to summarize relevant academic volunteer and leadership experience for those who have limited work experience A summary is most appropriate for someone with substantial experience someone who is changing careers and wants to demonstrate transferable skills or someone with a varied background They re most often used by graduate students and working professionals Education If your education relates to your objective and is within the past three years it should be the first section If not education should follow the work experience section of your resume In reverse chronological order this section includes the schools you have attended dates of graduation or dates of attendance as well as degrees sought or completed Other information that might be included related coursework scholarships and honors and special projects e g research projects teaching Start with your most recent degree or the program in which you are currently enrolled List other degrees or relevant education in reverse chronological order Highlight key info by using bold type or capital letters Most students begin with the university followed by the location degree and graduation date You can consider listing your degree before the name of the university as well Should I include my GPA If you are uncertain about including your GPA ask a Career Services advisor for recommendations based on your individual circumstances Within this section you may also want to highlight coursework research or a study abroad experience Consider listing relevant coursework under the appropriate degree You may want to describe thesis research or design projects Note You may want to have a separate Related Course Projects section see examples in this handout Chronological Format In the chronological resume job history is organized chronologically with the most recent job listed first Job titles and employers are emphasized and duties and accomplishments are described in detail Begin with your current most recent position and work backward chronologically Devote more space to relevant employment experiences If your job titles relate to your current job objective start each position description with job titles If not begin with the organization Follow job title and organizational information with the organization s city and state Use the first and last month or semester terms such as Fall Spring and Summer and year to describe dates of employment Describe experiences related to the position you re applying for in detail Summarize earlier positions unless relevant to your objective Within each listed position stress the major accomplishments and responsibilities that demonstrate your competency Resume Checklist The following checklist has been designed to assist you in writing your resume This checklist reflects the expertise of the Career Center staff developed through critiquing thousands of resumes discussing selection criteria with numerous employers and gathering input from a wide range of career professionals Appearance Is it inviting and easy to read not too much information uses appropriate font styles sans serif fonts are often recommended but the serif font Times New Roman is accepted and font sizes 10 12 pts Incorporates enough white space between sections to facilitate skimming adequate margins creates visual impact minimum is 5in on all four sides using bullets boldface italics and font sizes to emphasize key words for scannable resumes use boldface only Organization and Format Presents strongest qualifications first Appropriate length For most cases one page for undergraduates more for those with advanced degrees for several years of post grad work experience 2 3 pages Writing Style Begins phrases with powerful action verbs Short bullets 1 2 lines with 2 6 bullets per experience depending on how related it is to the opportunity you seek you can list an experience without listing bullets if you want the employer to know about your involvement but it s not directly related to the position Brief succinct language no unnecessary words Absolutely free from grammatical spelling punctuation usage and typographical errors CONTENT Contact Information Address current and permanent if necessary otherwise just choose one Telephone number Objective Optional Briefly indicates the sort of position title

semester of co op work experience prior to graduation The University s School of Engineering in Pittsburgh has a Cooperative Education program through which UPJ s Engineering Technology students can be placed in co op positions ET students who are interested in co op should see their faculty advisor 3 THE BIG S REFERRAL SYSTEM The Big S program is a computerized job referral system developed by Career Services to notify UPJ students of part time and summer job opportunities After job openings are received in the Career Services Office they are matched to the fields of interest which are listed on the registration form Once matches are made students are then sent a notice with a description of the job If the student is interested in the position it is up to him her to contact the employer usually by sending a resume and cover letter Register with the Big S in Career Services if you want to receive notices about part time and summer positions 4 WHERE DO I LOOK FOR CAREER RELATED POSITIONS By referring to the directories seniors use in their full time job hunt you can start a list of all the companies for which you would most like to work for Most of the companies listed in directories are very large and or nationwide but obviously they are also the companies that are able to conduct large summer hiring programs Because smaller companies do not hire in great volume it can be more difficult to seek them out but do not rule them out A good rule to follow is don t leave any stone unturned Joe Schmo s Fish Market may need summer help to balance the books A good place to look for summer positions is with the state or the federal government There are a vast number of opportunities in the many agencies A good way to find out about these opportunities would be to check the websites and best ways to find summer employment are to research write letters talk to as many people as you can and distribute your resume as much as possible Remember Career Services can provide you with a lot of good resources It s to your advantage to utilize this office And also even if you don t get a position that provides experience in your profession you can gain valuable communication and organizational skills simply by delivering pizzas or waiting tables 5 WHERE DO I LOOK FOR A SUMMER JOB Many people don t realize that they have an effective job referral system at their fingertips This network uses no forms costs nothing and has an amazing success rate as high as 80 percent All you need to do to take advantage of this job network is get the word out to friends relatives professors etc Many jobs are found just by asking people you know to keep an eye out for job openings Give your resume to these people Ask them to circulate it to those who might need a person with a background like yours When picking up and dropping off an application or a resume it s always best to do these things in person look sharp If a person s appearance is sloppy and unkempt a potential employer will take an application and file it away under NO WAY If the position requires that you complete an application fill it out in blue or black ink NEATLY The appearance and condition of your application could tell a great deal about you to an employer A great looking application may not get you a job but a sloppy application will most certainly stop you from being hired If you are asked to interview for a position make sure you are dressed properly Neatness counts in any interview so try to look your best Remove any facial piercing cover tattoos and avoid extreme hairdos and clothing Men should have facial hair neatly groomed Women should use make up conservatively When interviewing for professional positions professional attire is expected 6 HOW RESUMES FOR UNDERGRADUATES DIFFER FROM THOSE OF SENIORS AND ALUMNI Whereas college graduates typically do not include information from their high school years on their resumes undergraduates may and normally do use such information The younger you are the more likely it is that you will use information from your high school years Your objective if you include one should say that you are seeking a summer position a part time job an internship or a co op position You may choose to include your QPA if it is average or above It may help to list the courses that you have taken in high school or college that relate to the position for which you are applying It is generally advisable to list your computer skills Even though career related experience is most significant all work experience is valuable If you mowed lawns worked in fast food baby sat etcetera don t shy away from putting it on your resume Your activities and interests can be a real asset They can display a great deal about you They show how active you are how willing you are to serve others and frequently indicate leadership traits and communication and organizational skills You should have at least three references Those that you list as references should not be personal friends or family members Teachers professors and supervisors from places at which you worked make the best references List their name title place of employment address and telephone number References are normally typed on a separate sheet of paper and given to the employer upon request 7 RESUME WRITING TIPS Writing a resume can be a daunting experience The following is a list of tips compiled from the advice of employers career counselors and recent graduates whose resumes helped them land meaningful employment Pay careful attention to spelling punctuation grammar and style Proofread your resume carefully using a dictionary and stylebook and have several other people proofread it as well Organize information in a logical fashion Keep descriptions clear and to the point Confine your information to one page Use a simple easy to read font Use good quality white or off white bond paper Include as much work experience as possible even if it doesn t obviously relate to the job you re seeking Tailor your information to the job you re seeking Seek help at your career services center For more information on preparing a resume and other jobsearch ideas visit your career center National Association of Colleges and Employers 8 INFORMATION THAT APPEARS ON MOST RESUMES 1 Personal Information Name Campus Permanent Addresses Telephone Numbers and an E mail Address 2 *Employment Goals This is normally called the Career Objective or simply Objective Describe the type of work you desire The objective should reflect your short range plans For those with little or no full time work experience the development of a concisely described job objective may be the most difficult task in compiling a resume If you find that a specific career objective is too confining or doesn t meet your needs there are options available a You may decide to write your objectives in functional terms that describe the type of work activities you prefer instead of a description or title b Eliminate the employment goal section on your resume and incorporate your objective in your cover letter c Have several resumes with different objectives that you would send to the appropriate employers 3 Education Name of College s Location Dates Degree s Major s Quality Point Average* Honors and perhaps courses of particular value if they are related to employment for which you are applying Whereas college graduates typically do not include high school background undergraduates frequently find it advantageous to do so 4 Skills You may decide to include a section that lists your computer skills foreign languages licenses CPR commercial driving etc and other skills 5 Experience Part time employment summer employment applicable college projects internships volunteer work This section may be divided into three areas career related experience part time employment and summer experience For undergraduates with little or no full time professional level work experience it is very important to include part time and summer jobs even if the type of work has no bearing on academic or career plans Remember that career related experience is most valuable but a proven track record of other successful experience also makes you a more attractive candidate NOTE It is much more important to emphasize what your experiences were description explanation rather than when and where dates places 6 Military Service For those who have completed military obligations the dates of active duty and rank upon discharge should be included When appropriate include a brief description of duties and responsibilities particularly if the experience relates to future employment If you do not have any military experience omit this section 9 7 Activities and Interests These include extra curricular college and or community experiences and any leadership positions A brief listing of hobbies or avocations is acceptable Teacher education candidates should include all experiences working with children and adolescents Candidates for teaching positions might choose to include their own high school activities 8 *References List 3 or 4 persons Give name professional title business address and business phone These are normally listed on a separate sheet of paper If you decide not to list your references on your resume you could indicate that References are available upon request Do not use personal friends and relatives as references Teachers faculty and former supervisors make the best references * indicates optional Please Note Traditional advice has been to use action verbs when writing resumes and cover letters A list of action verbs you might consider using in your resume is provided in the back of this booklet Although the use of action verbs is still considered important you also should be aware of a recent trend Many large organizations are using computers to do the first scanning of resumes When scanned these computers can quickly review thousands of resumes However be aware that they normally scan for nouns not verbs Action verbs may have a greater effect when a human being does the first scanning of your resume but verbs may not impress a computer In essence both action verbs and important descriptive nouns that describe your qualifications such as titles or positions are important 10 SAMPLE RESUMES Please use the following resumes as examples only Look at all the resumes before you begin to construct your own Your resume will serve you best if it is unique and highlights your own personal qualifications Choosing a format that you like and then blending bits and pieces of a variety of examples will make your resume appear as if it is original Resumes copied from somebody else or produced from a template are normally not as effective as original resumes 11 Duncan Donaldson Duncan444@upj com Home Address 84 Trueman Avenue Altoona PA 15947 814 555 8444 Campus Address P O Box

Tips @ MS of Electrical Engineering 2013 2014 Academic Year Always avoid clich s I am a hard worker Highlight your strengths but always follow up statements ab out your competencies I have advanced technical skills with a specific example Questions to ask yourself 1 Does this resume stand up to the brand I wish to convey to employers Your resume is a marketing presentation of you It is a document with a purpose and summarizes your education experience and skills in short concrete result oriented phrases that puts together the right picture of you 2 Which three people can I show this to for a variety of responses and constructive criticism You need a resume that can appeal to different pairs of eyes and people are subjective so be sure to gather various opinions during your editing process 3 What should I put in the cover letter rather than in the resume The cover letter is an opportunity to introduce yourself in full sentences and should explain how you learned about the position and why you are interested and qualified for the role in comparison to a resume which highlights the tasks and responsibilities of your work and educational experience in bullet points Also note there is a difference between a formal 3 4 paragraph cover letter and an email introduction to the prospective employer The email form should be a brief 1 paragraph note that pulls from the first and last paragraph of your formal cover letter and should be edited and reviewed thoroughly for errors before hitting send Ingredients for a Knock out Resume Keep your resume to one page Use an attractive and professional layout Catch the reader s attention in 15 seconds Start each bullet point with an active verb Make everything positive on your resume Your resume should convey a sense of vitality and an image of you progressing smoothly and confidently through your career rather than having bumps Tailor your resume to a job description whenever possible Identify the five main qualities in the description and make sure those five qualities or as many as you can describe that are clearly demonstrated in your resume Highlight achievements rather than listing everything you have done Avoid raising unanswered questions and don t leaving gaps in your resume Whether you served in the military or did some traveling while unemployed or took a sabbatical include a brief description to set the tone of a continued career progression Proofread not just spell grammar check Check for tenses Make sure to set your computer language to U S English DO NOT Include o Personal Information too personal Age gender marital status number of children o Repetitious use of words Responsible for Duties include Resume and Cover Letter Tips @ MS of Electrical Engineering o o o o Your

Process Modelling under the guidance of Prof A S Moharir Department of Chemical Engineering IIT Bombay Jan 08 present Details BTX hydrocarbons Benzene Toluene and Xylenes are mainly obtained by catalytic reforming of Naphthas and Naphtha feedstock represents about 80% of the production cost of BTX Therefore it is necessary to substitute a less expensive material for Naphtha Liquified petroleum gas LPG which is produced in excess and has high transportation costs can be used as an alternative feed for the production of aromatics Cyclar process which is developed recently by UOP and BP uses a Gallium loaded zeolite catalyst for converting LPG into aromatic products The main achievements of this project are Proposed a mechanism for the aromatization of alkanes on HZSM 5 and GaHZSM 5 catalysts Developed a simulation model for the aromatization of both Propane and n Butane over GaHZSM 5 Performed simulations and obtain concentration profiles of various components along the PFR Extended the model to an Adiabatic plug flow reactor and Obtained the temperature profile along the PFR which will optimize the selectivity of the aromatics Determine the reactor configuration which gives better yield of aromatics Graduation Project Process Development Studies on Biodiesels Details Biodiesels consists of short chain alkyl esters which are produced from renewable resources like animal fats and plant seeds Biodiesels are not only eco friendly but also biodegradable and non toxic Biodiesels are produced by transesterification reaction in which vegetable oil is chemically

Engineering,your resume and try to determine if they have a position that would work for you An objective statement that says you want a position that offers growth and advancement and the opportunity to expand on your education and training tells an employer that you are looking for what they can do for you not what you can do for them EDUCATION OR EXPERIENCE What to put first If your education is more pertinent to the work you are seeking than your employment history list your education first If your education is very pertinent to the job you may wish to list specific course titles that you have completed that are directly related to the work you would be doing If your employment history is more pertinent it should be listed first on your resume ACADEMIC BACKGROUND Your academic background should be included in the resume with your most recently obtained degree or most advanced degree listed first The usual method is to list the school name city and state degree earned and date of graduation If you are currently enrolled in school you can list your projected date of graduation If you have received honors at school were elected class president or supported yourself through college you can add those achievements to your resume under a heading such as Honors and Achievements If you feel that some of your coursework will be valuable to you on the job you may want a heading called Major Coursework or Pertinent Coursework where you would list specific classes by name If the name of the course does not make it obvious what the content of the course was you may want to add this information in parentheses OTHER POSSIBLE TOPIC OR SKILL HEADINGS Equipment Computer Expertise Qualifications Highlights Summary Language Competency Licenses Certificates Additional Training Professional Affiliations Strengths Accomplishments Achievements REFERENCES There are mixed opinions as to whether or not to have a references notation on your resume If you are squeezed for space it is probably in your best interest to use the space to sell yourself to the employer On the other hand if you are just starting out in the job market there is no harm in noting that you do have references available on your resume You should have references available to hand to the employer immediately and may want to include them with your resume as part of your application packet References are usually the last heading on your resume and are usually listed as Available upon Request References Attached Additional References Available Upon Request or References and Portfolio Available Upon Request Be sure that you have them typed and ready to hand out References should not be listed individually on the resume itself but rather on a separate sheet with an indication as to your relationship to the person you are listing as a reference For work related references you might list company presidents managers supervisors co workers or clients Personal references can include friends faculty landlords etc Providing a list of references works as long as a reference is still available at your prior employer A letter of recommendation gives you a hedge against the day that your reference moves on and you can no longer refer potential employers to them Be sure that you ask a person if they are willing to be a reference for you before you list them as a reference Check with your listed references regularly to be sure that they are still available 4 LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION If possible get a written letter of recommendation from as many people as possible before you leave a job or soon afterwards A written recommendation is a known quantity You can never be sure what someone says about you in a verbal recommendation Written letters of recommendation may be attached to a resume or given to a potential employer separately with your references A letter of recommendation can speak about you in more glowing terms than you would feel comfortable describing yourself Many employers want to speak to a reference rather than read a letter of recommendation They distrust letters of recommendation knowing that you would be unlikely to provide a less than glowing one and want to talk to your reference directly or even circumvent your listed references and speak to other people who may have worked with you at the company Always check with your references before listing them on an application to be sure that they are still available and willing to act as a reference for you If you are uneasy about what your references may be saying about you you can hire a reference checking service or have a friend act as a potential employer and call the reference you are concerned about If you choose to go this route give them a script to work from Many companies have a reference policy and will only verify that you were an employee and the dates that you worked for that company WHAT NOT TO PUT IN YOUR RESUME Do not put your age sex marital status number of children religious affiliation ethnic origin height weight or health status This information may be used to discriminate against you and is illegal for employers to ask prior to hiring you It is also advisable not to list political or professional affiliations unless they are directly job related Do not include past salaries or anticipated starting salary This information may be requested by an employer however the consensus with employment professionals is that it is not in your best interest to include the information in writing You have to choose whether or not you feel you background is strong enough that they will want to speak to you without this information If you include a section of hobbies or extracurricular activities it is recommended that you leave out any activities that could be considered physically hazardous Employers want you on the job not recovering from your recreational activities REMEMBER Your resume should be free of spelling grammatical and typographical errors Have it proof read Never assume that a computer spell check will find all errors Keep it simple Do not use brightly colored paper or a variety of graphics or fonts or font sizes Have your resume printed on good quality rag bond paper Have you references list and letters of recommendation and cover letter printed on the same paper as your resume If possible avoid plain white paper If your resume will be scanned not a usual occurrence in Santa Cruz but common in Silicon Valley be sure to provide a scanner friendly version If you are doing a web based resume be sure any links to or from that web link are professional Do not post your picture on line as part of your on line resume Do not send out a resume that has cross outs or things handwritten in Take the time to do it right 5 KEY WORDS FOR RESUME PREPARATION Ability Accelerated Accomplished Accurate Achieved Active Adapted Adjusted Administer Advertised Advised Aggressive Ambitions Analyze Analytical
