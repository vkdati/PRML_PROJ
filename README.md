 Initial Plan:
 Design a machine learning-powered resume screening system to improve hiring efficiency while ensuring fairness and transparency.
 Develope models to extract transferable skills, quantify project impact, and detect leadership traits using NLP and pattern recognition.
 Implement Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and K-means clustering to classify career archetypes.
 Build bias mitigation techniques, including adversarial debiasing, reweighting, and causal intervention, to reduce hiring biases.
 Integrate Google Cloud AutoML for real-time deployment and interactive bias audit tools for recruiters.
 Achieved faster screening time and improvement in diversity metrics through A/B testing
