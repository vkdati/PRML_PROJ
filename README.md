üß† RESUME CLASSIFIER

üöÄ Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced recruitment environment, HR professionals and recruiters sift through hundreds of resumes to match candidates to suitable job roles. This manual process is time-consuming, prone to bias, and inefficient, especially when dealing with large volumes of applicants.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced:
- Manual resume screening is slow and inconsistent.
- Resumes come in unstructured formats, making automated parsing difficult.
- Assigning the right job role often requires contextual understanding of skills, experience, and keywords.

‚úÖ Solution
Resume Classifier is an intelligent machine learning-based solution that classifies resumes into suitable job roles such as "HR", "Engineer", "Architect", etc. It uses NLP techniques to extract meaningful patterns and classifies resumes based on their content.

üß∞ Features
- Automatically reads and parses resumes.
- Classifies into job roles using a trained classification model.
- Uses TF-IDF for feature extraction and various classification models to handle imbalanced datasets.
- Gives higher importance to rare job roles to avoid bias towards majority classes. 
- Supports .pdf format.
